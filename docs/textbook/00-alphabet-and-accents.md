## Alphabet

The ancient Greek alphabet consists of 24 letters, either **vowels** or **consonants**. Every Greek word must contain at least one vowel sound, whether it consists of a single letter or two letters that form a **diphthong** (on which see below), and the number of vowel sounds in a word indicates the number of syllables that the word contains.

See this video by Prof. Katie DeBoer of Xavier University on how each of the letters is pronounced, and then reinforce your understanding with the text and exercise that follow:

The 24 letters of the Greek alphabet are as follows:

| Letter      | Lowercase | Uppercase | Pronunciation |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| alpha      | α       | Α | *ah* as in "f**a**ther" |
| beta   | β        | Β | *b* as in "**b**oat" |
| gamma | γ | Γ | hard *g* as in "**g**oat" |
| delta | δ | Δ | *d* as in "**d**og" |
| epsilon | ε | Ε | *eh* as in "**e**lephant" |
| zeta | ζ | Ζ | *zd* as in "wi**sd**om" or *dz* as in "be**ds**" |
| eta | η | Η | *ay* as in "f**a**te" |
| theta | θ | Θ | aspirated *t* as in "**t**able" (unlike the t in "a**t**" or "ho**t**") |
| iota | ι | Ι | (short) *ih* as in "h**i**m" or (long) *ee* as in "st**ee**l" |
| kappa | κ | Κ | *k* as in "**c**ould" |
| lambda | λ | Λ | *l* as in "**l**and" |
| mu | μ | Μ | *m* as in "**m**ouse" |
| nu | ν | Ν | *n* as in "**n**ail" |
| xi | ξ | Ξ | *ks* as in "e**cs**tacy" or "a**x**le" |
| omicron | ο | Ο | (short) *aw* as in "c**ou**gh" |
| pi | π | Π | *p* as in "**p**uppy" |
| rho | ρ | Ρ | *rh* as in "**rh**ododendron" |
| sigma | σ (inside word)<br>ς (at word end) | Σ | *s* as in "**s**illy" |
| tau | τ | Τ | *t* as in "i**t**" |
| upsilon | υ | Υ | (short) *uh* as in "**u**nder" or (long) *ooh* as in "tr**u**th" |
| phi | φ | Φ | aspirated *p* as in "she**ph**erd" |
| chi | χ | Χ | aspirated *k* as in "**ch**aracter" |
| psi | ψ | Ψ | *ps* as in "u**ps**ide" |
| omega | ω | Ω | *oh* as in "b**oa**t" |

And here is a video that shows how to draw each of these characters:

Some ideas to note:

* There are three aspirated letters: θ, φ, and χ. "Aspirated" comes from the Latin verb *adspiro*, "to breathe", so the aspirated letters add a forceful breath (basically a "h" exhalation) to the pronunciation of the core consonant sound: θ = t + h; φ = p + h; χ = k + h.

* There are three double consonants: ζ, ξ, and ψ. Each is pronounced as two successive consonant sounds: ζ = z + d or d + z (your choice, though I [Prof. Libatique] will usually default to z + d); ξ = k + s; and ψ = p + s.

* The vowels in Greek can be classified as **long, short, or either**. This length essentially determines how long it takes to pronounce the vowel and what the vowel sounds like.
  * The vowels that are *always* short are ε (a short η) and ο (a short ω).
  * The vowels that are *always* long are η (a long ε) and ω (a long ο).
  * The vowels that can be either short or long are α, ι, and υ. Often, if such a vowel's length matters, you will see a macron (-) over the vowel in question to mark it as long.

* Vowels may also be combined into **diphthongs**, a single vowel sound composed of multiple vowels. These are the possible diphthongs in Greek:
  * αι = *eye* as in "wh**y**"
  * αυ = *ow* as in "w**ow**"
  * ει = *ay* as in "sl**ei**gh"
  * ευ = *eh-ooh* (no direct equivalence in English)
  * ηυ = *ay-ooh* (no direct equivalence in English)
  * οι = *oy* as in "t**oy**"
  * ου = *ooh* as in "tr**oo**p"
  * υι = *wee* as in "s**wee**t"

* If a Greek word begins with a single vowel or a diphthong, there will be a **breathing mark** that looks like a comma above the single vowel or the second letter of the diphthong. Sometimes, this breathing mark will be combined with another accent mark, on which see below.
  * If the open section of the comma faces left, the mark is called a **smooth breathing mark**, and it doesn't affect the pronunciation of the vowel. For example, the initial sound of ἄνθρωπος is "ah."
  * If the open section of the comma faces right, the mark is called a **rough breathing mark**, and it adds an "h" sound before the vowel or diphthong. For example, the initial sound of ὑπέρ is "hoo."

* **iota subscript**. Occasionally, you will see a small mark underneath α, η, or ω (ᾳ, ῃ, ῳ). These marks are called *iota subscripts* and technically form diphthongs with the vowel that they occur underneath. Note: the iota does *not* affect pronunciation of the core vowel, but it is essential to note where the subscript appears, since its appearance can make a word function in a completely different way within a sentence. For example, there is a major difference between the words οἰκία and οἰκίᾳ, as you'll learn in the modules to come.

### Practice Opportunity 1

Try pronouncing the following words. Do not worry about the accents besides the breathing marks above the letters for now.

1. φωνή
2. φωνῇ
3. ἡδεῖα
4. Ζεύς
5. ἄνθρωπος
6. ἄνθρωποι
7. ψυχῶν
8. λαμβάνουσιν
9. ἔλαβον
10. ὑπό

## Accents

Ancient Greek utilizes three different accent marks that, like breathing marks, occur over a single vowel (or over the second letter of a diphthong):
* the **acute**, which looks like a forward slash: δείκνυμι.
* the **circumflex**, which looks like an upside-down u (^) or a tilde: ὁδῷ.
* the **grave**, which looks like a back slash: ὁδὸς.

Note that these accent marks can occur in combination with the breathing marks described above. If a breathing mark occurs with an acute or grave, the breathing mark will be to the left and the acute or grave will be to the right: for example, ἄνθρωπος, ἓξ. If a breathing mark occurs with a circumflex, it will be written *below* the circumflex: for example, ηὗρον, ἦλθον.

According to our best guesses, these accent marks indicated the way that one's pitch should rise or lower as the word was pronounced. An acute seems to indicate a rise, a grave seems to indicate a drop, and a circumflex seems to indicate a rise followed by a drop in pitch. However, since we do not have any recordings of the ancients pronouncing these words, we cannot be entirely sure of what this pitch modification actually sounded like. Often, modern speakers of ancient Greek words will tend to stress the syllable on which the accent (whatever accent it is) falls, rather than modifying the pitch. So, for example, in the word ἄνθρωπος, the stress falls on the first syllable: AN-throw-pos; but in the word λεγομένου, the stress falls on the second-to-last syllable: leh-goh-MEH-noo.

Accents can, however, help us disambiguate between different forms of words, so it can be important to know what they look like and where they can fall within a word. So, note the following general rules (though exceptions abound and will be noted in the coming modules):

* An accent can only ever fall on one of the last three syllables of a word:
  * the final syllable (the **ultima**, from Latin *ultimus*, "last")
  * the second-to-last syllable (the **penult**, from Latin *paene* + *ultimus*, "almost last")
  * or the third-to-last syllable (the **antepenult**, from Latin *ante* + *paene* + *ultimus*, "before the almost-last")

* An **acute** can appear over any of the three syllables. For example, ἄνθρωπος; κελεύω; ψυχή.

* A **circumflex** can appear *only* over the penult or the ultima and *only* over long vowels or diphthongs. For example: ψυχῇ, ποιεῖτο; ὧς.

* A **grave** can appear *only* over an ultima. For example: ψυχὴ.
  * The grave usually occurs when an acute falls on the ultima of a word that is followed immediately by another word that is not an enclitic (on which see below); in such a case, the acute becomes a grave. If the word in question is followed by a punctuation mark or an enclitic, however, the accent remains an acute. So, notice where the graves occur (and where they don't) in the following sentence: ἰσχυραὶ ἡ οἰκία καὶ ἡ ψυχή. "The household and the soul are strong."

An **enclitic** is a word or syllable that affects the accentuation of the word that precedes it according to the following rules:

* If the word that precedes the enclitic has an acute or grave on the ultima, that accent will remain or become acute. For example, ἡ ψυχή γε (rather than the expected ἡ ψυχὴ γε).

* If the word that precedes the enclitic has either: an acute on the antepenult OR a circumflex on the penult, OR if the word that precedes the enclitic is a monosyllable (one-syllable word) with no accent, the enclitic will **add** an acute to the ultima of the preceding word. For example, ποιεῖτό τι; ἄνθρωποί τινες; εἴ τις.

* If the word that precedes the enclitic has a circumflex on the ultima, no change occurs.

* If the word that precedes the enclitic has an acute on the penult, no change occurs to the preceding word, BUT if the enclitic has two syllables, the enclitic itself receives an acute or grave on its ultima, according to normal rules. For example: ἀκούονται λόγοι τινές. BUT λόγοι τινὲς ἀκούονται. "Some words are heard." If the enclitic is monosyllabic (one syllable long), then no change occurs.
