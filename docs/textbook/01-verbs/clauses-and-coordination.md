## Unit Vocabulary

Please memorize the following dictionary entries, which will be used in this unit.

* καί - "and, even, also" (καί ... καί or τε ... τε - "both ... and")
* τε - (enclitic, post-positive) "and"
* ἀλλά - "but"
* δέ - (post-positive) "and, but"
* ἤ - "or" (ἤ ... ἤ - "either ... or")
* γάρ - (post-positive) "for" (conjunction), "because"
* οὖν - (post-positive) "therefore"
* μέν ... δέ (... δέ ...) - [denotes elements of a list]

## Clauses and Coordination

A phrase that uses a **finite verb** is called a **clause**, and individual clauses are often defined by the finite verb, which tells us what else we can expect in the clause: the subject, direct or indirect objects, prepositional phrases, etc. We'll be able to fill in those latter elements starting in module 2 when we begin talking about substantives like nouns and pronouns.

If we were to simply add clause after clause as we speak or write, however, it would make for boring reading.

* The soldier showed the house. The sailor boarded the ship.

What is the relationship between these clauses? How can we make a logical connection between the ideas contained in the first sentence and the second?

## Coordinating Conjunctions

That is where **conjunctions** and **particles** can help us out.

A **conjunction** (from the Latin verb *coniungo, coniungere, coniunxi, coniunctus*, "to join together") joins together two or more equal elements, from the level of individual words to entire clauses and sentences. Examples in English include words like "and" or "but". Note also the conjunction that joins together those two possibilities: "or."

Here are some examples of conjunctions in Greek and how they connect ideas together:
* καί and τε couple together clauses: "and"
* ἀλλά introduces a clause that strongly contrasts the previous clause: "but"
* δέ can either connect clauses together or imply a contrast (weaker than ἀλλά): "and" or "but"
* ἤ indicates options: "or"

In terms of the difference between ἀλλά and δέ, think of ἀλλά as a "big but" and δέ as a "small but."

Note that τε and δέ are **post-positive**, which we'll discuss below.

More specifically, each of the words above is a **coordinating conjunction**, defined here as a conjunction that joins elements together on its own (versus **correlative conjunctions**, which we'll discuss in the next section).

Here are some examples of how these conjunctions can be used:
* ἔδειξαν καὶ ἐκέλευσαν. "They showed, *and* they ordered."
* ἐκελεύσαντο, ἀλλὰ ἐδείχθησαν. "They ordered, *but* they were shown."
* ἦλθεν ἢ ἤγαγεν. "She came *or* she led."

***

## Correlative Conjunctions

**Correlative conjunctions** are combinations of conjunctions that are used together to strengthen the relationships between the items being joined. In more plain English, correlative conjunctions help us more clearly identify what elements are being joined together.

There are two specific sets of correlative conjunctions in your vocabulary for this unit:
* καί ... καί and τε ... τε mean "both ... and"
* ἤ ... ἤ means "either ... or"

Whenever you see a καί or an ἤ, you must look at the full context of the clauses around it to see if there's another καί or ἤ to form a correlative conjunction. If so, the "both" and the "either", respectively, of the correlative conjunction can help you organize your translation better. If not, then the καί or ἤ in question is simply a coordinating conjunction and can be translated straightforwardly as "and" or "or" respectively. Some examples (with comparisons to sentences with coordinating conjunctions):

* καί ἤλθετο καί ἠγάγετο. "He *both* came *and* led."
* ἤλθετο καί ἠγάγετο. "He came *and* led."
* ἢ ἔδειξαν ἢ ἐδείχθησαν. "They *either* showed *or* were shown."
* ἔδειξαν ἢ ἐδείχθησαν. "They showed *or* were shown."

## Particles

A **particle** is a word that contextualizes the idea in the clause that contains it. The relationship between the particle and the clause that contains it is similar to flavor agents in a culinary dish: in the same way that salt versus citrus versus sugar can create different flavor profiles in the same dish, different particles can lend different interpretations of how a clause relates to the clauses around it.

Here are some examples of particles:
* γάρ gives an explanation for the previous clause. Why did it happen? "for/because..."
* οὖν draws a conclusion from the previous clause. This happened; "therefore..."

And here are some examples of these particles in use:
* ἦλθον· ἤχθησαν γὰρ, "They came, for they were led." (The second clause, which contains γάρ, explains why they came. We'll discuss the placement of the γάρ below.)
* ἐσχέθη· ἐκελεύσατο οὖν. "He was held; therefore, he gave the order." (The second clause, which contains οὖν, indicates that him giving the order was the result or outcome of being held.)

***

## Post-Positives

Some of the conjunctions and particles discussed above are **post-positive** (from the Latin preposition *post*, "after", and verb *pono, ponere, posui, positus*, "to place")

***

## μέν ... δέ

## Practice Opportunity

Use the verbs that you learned in the previous units and the following vocabulary (to be used for this exercise only, no need to memorize) to render the English sentence into Greek.

* "the house": ἡ οἰκία (as the **subject** of a verb), τήν οἰκίαν (as the **object** of a verb)
* "the horses": οἱ ἵπποι (as the **subject** of a verb), τοὺς ἵππους (as the **object** of a verb)
* "the sailor": ὁ ναύτης (as the **subject** of a verb), τόν ναύτην (as the **object** of a verb)
* "the soldiers": οἱ στρατιῶται (as the **subject** of a verb), τοὺς στρατιώτας (as the **object** of a verb)

1. The soldiers ordered the horses, and the sailor showed the house.
2. The sailor came, but the horses were led.
3. The sailor showed the house because the soldiers held the horses.
