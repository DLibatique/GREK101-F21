## Imperfect Tense

The third (and, for this semester, final) tense that we will consider is the **imperfect** tense, which indicates an action that occurred in the past *over a period of time*. Compare this against the aorist, which indicates an *instant or completed* action in the past. Here are some examples in English:

* They *were showing* the evidence.
* He *was being ordered* to speak.
* She *was leading* the dog on a walk.

Because the imperfect tense indicates an action in progress, we use a past tense form of the verb "to be" (i.e., "was" or "were" depending on the person and number of the subject) and the -ing form of the verb in question to emphasize its progressive nature. Compare these examples against their aorist equivalents:

* They *showed* the evidence.
* He *was ordered* to speak.
* She *led* the dog on a walk.

In each of these, the action is happening at a moment in time, whereas in the imperfect examples, the action is in progress.

## Forming the Imperfect

In order to conjugate verbs in the imperfect tense, we will need to draw on many of the tactics and skills we've discussed over the course of this module on verbs.

Like all other finite verb tenses that we've learned so far, the imperfect is a combination of a verb stem and a personal ending.

For our imperfect stem, we will use the first principal part, as we did with the present tense.

However, we will combine that first principal part stem with elements of the aorist tense, namely the augment and second aorist endings.

### Augment

Recall from the unit on the [first aorist](first-aorist#augments) that the **augment** is a marker that indicates that **a finite verb is in a past tense and in the indicative mood**. It is either **syllabic** (meaning that you add an ἐ- to the beginning of a verb that begins with a consonant) or **temporal** (meaning that you lengthen the initial vowel of a verb that begins with a vowel). Because the imperfect tense is a past tense, it follows logically that forms of the imperfect will exhibit an augment.

Remember, though, from our discussion of [principal parts](overview#dictionary-entry) that the **first principal part**, on which we'll build the imperfect, is the **1st sg.** ***present*** **active indicative** of a verb (hence, κελεύω > κελεύει, "he orders" or δείκνυμι > δείκνυνται, "they order [for themselves]"); hence, the first principal part does not have an augment built in, unlike the third and sixth principal parts (e.g., syllabic augments on verbs like ἐκέλευσα and ἐδείχθην or temporal augments on verbs like ἤγαγον or ἦλθον). Thus, **we have to add an augment to the stem of the first principal part in order to form the imperfect stem**.

For first principal parts that begin with a consonant, this is easy enough: simply add the syllabic ἐ- to the beginning of the form. Thus:

* κελεύω > ἐ- + κελευ- = ἐκελευ-
* δείκνυμι > ἐ- + δείκνυ- = ἐδεικνυ-

For first principal parts that begin with a vowel, however, we need a temporal augment, and the lengthening of a vowel is not always intuitive. For example, some verbs that begin with ε- will lengthen that epsilon to η-, while others will lengthen it to ει- (for fascinating linguistic reasons that we do not have time to get into right now but you can feel free to ask Prof. Libatique to nerd out about in class).

The best resource to learn a verb's temporal augment will be our [master verb principal part list](../../reference/verb-principal-parts) (this link takes you to the "Verb Principal Parts" page of the Reference section of our textbook). Next to a first principal part that begins with a vowel, you will note in parentheses the term "impf." and a verb stem; this stem is the **imperfect stem, including the augment**, that you should use in forming the imperfect. For example:

* ἄγω > impf. ἠγ- (η is a lengthening of α)
* ἔρχομαι > impf. ἠρχ- (η is a lengthening of ε)
* ἔχω > impf. εἰχ- (ει is a lengthening of ε)

### Endings

Once you have your imperfect stem, the next step is to affix the appropriate personal endings for the person, number, and voice of the imperfect that you want. Like the present tense, **the imperfect tense has only two forms: one for the active voice and one for the middle** ***and*** **passive voice.**

As with the present tense, you must also take into consideration whether the verb in question is **-ω** or **-μι**, as the conjugation to which the verb belongs will dictate what sets of endings you can use.

#### Imperfect Endings (-ω / Thematic)

| Person and Number | Active | Middle/Passive |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | `-ον` | `-όμην` |
| 2nd sg. | `-ες` | `-ου` |
| 3rd sg. | **-ε(ν)** | **-ετο** |
| 1st pl. | `-ομεν` | `-όμεθα` |
| 2nd pl. | `-ετε` | `-εσθε` |
| 3rd pl. | **-ον** | **-οντο** |

Note that these endings are *exactly* equivalent to the endings for the [second aorist](second-aorist).

#### Imperfect Endings (-μι / Athematic)

| Person and Number | Active | Middle/Passive |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | `-ν` | `-μην` |
| 2nd sg. | `-ς` | `-σο` |
| 3rd sg. | **--**\* | **-το** |
| 1st pl. | `-μεν` | `-μεθα` |
| 2nd pl. | `-τε` | `-σθε` |
| 3rd pl. | **-σαν** | **-ντο** |

\* This dash means that there is no ending for the 3rd singular active.

Note that as with [present thematic versus athematic endings](present#present-middlepassive-endings--ω), the difference between thematic and athematic imperfect verb endings is easy to see when we compare across the paradigm charts. The thematic vowel are for the most part the athematic endings with the theme vowel -ε- or -ο- prefixed to them (with the exception of the 3rd plural active). For the comparison of the 2nd sg. middle/passive, see the link above re: intervocalic sigma.

#### Application
{: .no_toc }

Here is the list of steps to follow to conjugate a verb in the imperfect tense:

1. Get the verb's stem from the first principal part by removing the -ω (or -ομαι for deponents) or -μι (or -μαι for deponents).
2. **Add an augment to the stem**, either a syllabic augment or a temporal augment.
3. Add the appropriate ending to indicate person, number, and voice.
4. Apply a recessive accent.

You'll notice that these steps are largely the same process that you would take to conjugate in the aorist or present tenses; the only extra step is the addition of an augment to the stem.

## Imperfect Versus Aorist

The imperfect and the aorist share two major similarities: the augment and the personal endings. So, how can we tell the imperfect and the aorist apart? The answer lies in the **verb stem** and, more specifically, **from which principal part the verb stem derives.** Recall that the **aorist** is built on the third and sixth principal parts, while the **imperfect** is built on the first.
