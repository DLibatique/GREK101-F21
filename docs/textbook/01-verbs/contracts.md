## Contract Verbs

All of the verbs that you have encountered so far have a first principal part whose stem ends in a consonant or υ. Some quick examples:

* ἄγω > ἀγ-
* κελεύω > κελευ-
* δείκνυμι > δεικνυ-
* ἔρχομαι > ἐρχ-

However, when the stem of a first principal part ends in the letters **ε**, **α**, or **ο**, as in the three verb entries above, that end of the stem will **contract** with the first vowel/diphthong of whatever personal ending gets added to the stem. For that reason, such verbs are called **contract verbs**. The most common type are **epsilon-contracts**, so we will focus on those for this unit and learn about alpha- and omicron-contracts at a later time.

Note that **contractions are only a concern for forms built on the first principal part, i.e., the present and imperfect tenses.** (There are also contracts in the future tense that we'll discuss when we learn about the future tense.) This means that you do not need to worry about contractions in the aorist tense (i.e., forms built on the 3rd or 6th principal parts).

## Epsilon Contractions

This list indicates what results from the contraction of a verb stem's -ε- with the various vowel/diphthong possibilities in present and imperfect personal endings. The combinations in bold are the ones that are directly applicable to the endings that you should have memorized by this point (3rd singular and plural in all voices of the present and the imperfect); the coded-out combinations are ones that will apply to endings that you will learn later on this year.

* **ε + ει = ει**
* **ε + ου = ου**
* **ε + ε = ει**
* **ε + ο = ου**
* `ε + ᾱ = η`
* `ε + α = η`
* `ε + η = η`
* `ε + αι = ῃ`
* `ε + ῃ = ῃ`
* `ε + οι = οι`
* `ε + ω = ω`
* `ε + ῳ = ῳ`

## Conjugation and Accentuation

The contraction of the stem's epsilon with the following vowel simply adds an extra step into the process of conjugating in the present or imperfect tense:

1. find the stem (and add an augment if needed),
2. attach the appropriate personal ending,
3. **replace the clashing vowels with their resulting contraction**,
4. and apply a recessive accent.

The accentuation step will also have some specific rules, but let's take the verb ποιέω as an example and see how the contractions work when we conjugate it in the present and imperfect tenses (and deal with the accentuation when we get there).

As usual, we begin by finding the stem from the first principal part; when we take -ω off the verb, we are left with ποιε-. This -ε- at the end of the stem classifies ποιέω as a **contract verb**, so we must be sure to apply that step of contracting the ε with the personal ending's vowel/diphthong as we go.
