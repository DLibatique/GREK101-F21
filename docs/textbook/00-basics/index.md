# Basics

These two units discuss the ancient Greek alphabet, accentuation system, and inflection systems. You must be able to work with the alphabet in both written and vocal forms, have a basic understanding of how accents work, and how we use word stems and endings to indicat a word's function in a sentence, rather than word order as in English.
