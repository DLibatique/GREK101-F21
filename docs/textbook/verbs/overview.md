## Verbs - Definition

Ancient Greek, like English, has several **parts of speech** into which words can be classified. The first part of speech under consideration is the **verb**, defined here as a word that indicates **action** or a **state of being**. Take a look at the following examples in English:

* The defendant **showed** the evidence.
* You **had** my attention.
* The story **was** very long.
* The victims **were wronged**.

In each of these sentences, the verb is bolded and serves as the anchor of the entire sentence, communicating the idea that the sentence is trying to convey. Note that the verb can indicate **action** ("showed", "had", "were wronged") or a **static state** ("was"). We'll learn more about these distinctions as the module continues.

## Verb Aspects

Verbs can appear in different forms, including **infinitives** (verbal nouns, like "to make" or "to do") or **participles** (verbal adjectives, like "making" or "done"). For this module, however, we'll be focusing mostly on verbs that are **conjugated** (more on this in a bit).

As discussed in [the page on inflection](../inflection#conjugation), we can change the endings of verbs to reflect different aspects of the verb through a process called **conjugation**. A conjugated verb, then, exhibits five major **aspects** that we can glean through the verb's ending and the verb stem to which that ending is attached. This is merely a broad overview of verbal aspects; we will reinforce these ideas as the year continues, so do not worry if you're overwhelmed by all of these ideas now.

1. **person**. The **person** of a verb indicates the relationship of the speaker of the sentence of the subject.
    * **1st person** means that the speaker *is* the subject or is part of a group that serves as the subject. This is most often indicated through pronouns like "I" or "me" in the singular or "we" or "us" in the plural.
    * **2nd person** means that the speaker is *addressing** the subject. This is most often indicated through pronouns like "you" (singular or plural) or "y'all" (only plural).
    * **3rd person** means that the speaker is talking about someone that is neither the speaker nor the addressee. This is most often indicated through pronouns like "he, she, it, they" as subjects or "him, her, them" as objects.

2. **number**. The **number** of a verb indicates how many of the subject there are.
    * **singular** indicates that there is just one of the subject.
    * **plural** indicates that there are more than one of the subject.
    * **dual** indicates that there are exactly two of the subject. (The dual is relatively rare, but it tends to be used with subjects that are natural pairs like eyes or knees in early Greek works like the *Iliad* or the *Odyssey*.)

3. **tense**. The **tense** of a verb indicates *when* the action of the verb occurs. Focus for now on the first four, as the final three (perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect) are relatively rare, especially in comparison to the first four.
    * **imperfect** tense indicates that the action of the verb occurred continuously, over a period of time, in the past.
    * **aorist** tense indicates that the action of the verb happened instantaneously, at one single point, in the past. Note the difference between the **aorist** and the **imperfect**; the former is a single point, like a photograph, while the latter took place over a period of time, like a video.
    * **present** tense indicates that the action of the verb is happening *now*.
    * **future** tense indicates that the action of the verb will occur later but hasn't happened yet.
    * **perfect** tense indicates that the action of the verb occurred in the past with lasting effects into the present. For example, "he died" -- he died at a point in the past, but he is still dead today.
    * **pluperfect** tense indicates that the action of the verb occurred *before* another event in the past but had lasting effects into that past moment. For example, "he had died before the war ended" -- his death came before the war ended, and he was still dead when the war did end.
    * **future perfect** tense indicates that the action of the verb will have occurred *before* another event in the future but will have lasting effects into that future moment. For example, "he will have died before the war will end" -- his death will come before the war's end, and it will last into that future moment.

4. **voice**. The **voice** of a verb indicates the relationship of the subject to the action of the verb.
  * The verb's voice is **active** if the subject *performs* the action of the verb. For example, "The boy **loves** the girl." The boy performs the action of loving.
  * The verb's voice is **passive** if the subject *receives* the action of the verb. For example, "The girl **is loved** by the boy." The girl *receives* the action of loving, even though she is the subject, so the verb is considered passive.
  * The verb's voice is **middle** if the subject either performs the verb's action with some self-interested motive or performs the action upon themself. It's often difficult to express the middle voice in English, but often some form of a reflexive pronoun (e.g., "myself", "himself", "ourselves") can help. For example, "He *speaks for himself*" or "We *know ourselves*."

5. **mood**. The **mood** of a verb indicates how the speaker thinks about the quality of the verb's action.
  * **indicative** mood indicates that the speaker considers the verb's action a definite fact.
  * **imperative** mood indicates that the speaker considers the verb's action a command.
  * **subjunctive** mood indicates that the speaker considers the verb's action as less definite, a possibility rather than an established fact.
  * **optative** mood indicates that the speaker considers the verb's action a wish or even less definite than the subjunctive.

These five aspects apply mainly to **conjugated verbs**, here defined as verbs with a **person** and a **number**. Other verbal forms exhibit only some of the aspects (e.g., infinitives and participles both have tense and voice but not person, number, or mood); we will deal with those in later lessons.

So, in sum, a **conjugated verb** has some combination of the following five aspects:

1. **person**: 1st, 2nd, 3rd
2. **number**: singular, plural, dual
3. **tense**: imperfect, aorist, present, future, perfect, pluperfect, future perfect
4. **voice**: active, passive, middle
5. **mood**: indicative, imperative, subjunctive, optative

## Dictionary Entry

When you are learning verbs in ancient Greek, you must memorize the way that the verb's entry appears in a dictionary, such as the [master vocabulary list](../../vocabulary/master) for this very textbook. You'll notice that entries for verbs have seven sections: the first six are called **principal parts** and the seventh is the definition of the verb in English. Each of the **principal parts** gives you the stem for the verb's forms in certain tenses and voices. Here's an overview:

| Principal Part | Form of Verb | What You Conjugate With It |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1st | 1st sg. present | present and imperfect tense forms in all voices |
| 2nd | 1st sg. future | future active and middle forms |
| 3rd | 1st sg. aorist | aorist active and middle forms |
| 4th | 1st sg. perfect active | perfect, plupf., and fut. pf. active forms |
| 5th | 1st sg. perfect middle/passive | perfect, plupf., and fut. pf. middle/passive forms |
| 6th | 1st sg. aorist passive | aorist passive and future passive forms |

Some verbs may not have a principal part in each of the six slots. In such cases, you will see a -- where the verb's
