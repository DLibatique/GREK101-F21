## Principal Parts and Memorization

Many verbs have six principal parts, and while it is generally a good idea to memorize them all when you encounter new verbs, that is a lot to keep in mind. So, our goal in this textbook will be to keep the amount of vocabulary at a manageable level for retention and memorization and to suggest some strategies for memorizing piecemeal, rather than all in one fell swoop.

To that end, for the most, if not all, of this semester, we will be working primarily with four of the six principal parts of verbs: 1, 3, and 6. Please memorize those three principal parts and the definition of a verb as you come across new ones. We will format verb entries in the textbook (but not in the isolated vocabulary lists or reference charts) in such a way as to remind you what you should pay attention to: **bolded** principal parts should be memorized, while you can de-prioritize `coded` principal parts. So:

* **δείκνυμι**, `δείξω`, **ἔδειξα**, `δέδειχα`, `δέδειγμαι`, **ἐδείχθην**, "[to show](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n23658)"
* **κελεύω**, `κελεύσω`, **ἐκέλευσα**, `κεκέλευκα`, `κεκέλευσμαι`, **ἐκελεύσθην**, "[to order](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n56496)"

We will use these two verbs primarily in the coming lessons to demonstrate different verb forms and translations, so commit to memory the bolded forms above.

We will also use the **bolded** versus `coded` scheme in other contexts as well, so be attuned to that -- **bold** encourages memorization, while `code` is merely for your information.

## The Aorist

As discussed in [the verb overview](overview#verb-aspects), the **aorist tense** is used to indicate an instantaneous or completed verbal action that occurred in the past. Here are some English examples:

* He sighed.
* They arrived.

Note how these forms of the verb indicate a one-and-done event, rather than drawing attention to a process (e.g., "he *was sighing*" or "they *were arriving*"); for verbal actions that occurred over a period of time in the past, we would use the imperfect tense, which we'll learn about in the next unit.

In Greek, the aorist tense of a verb is formed using the **third** and **sixth** principal parts: the **third** helps us form the **active voice** ("she showed") and **middle voice** ("she showed for herself"), while the **sixth** helps us form the **passive voice** ("she was shown") voice.

### First and Second Aorists

The **third principal part** also indicates a very important distinction between two kinds of aorists: the **first aorist** (also known as a "weak aorist") and the **second aorist** (also known as a "strong aorist"). The distinction between the two dictates what sets of endings we can use to conjugate the verb in the aorist active and middle voices. This affects *only* the verbal forms that are built on the **third principal part**.

* A **first aorist** has a third principal part that ends in -α.
* A **second aorist** has a third principal part that ends in -ον.

### Augments

You will also notice that the third and sixth principal parts of δείκνυμι (ἔδειξα, ἐδείχθην) and κελεύω (ἐκέλευσα, ἐκελεύσθην) both begin with the letter ε, while their first principal parts do not. This initial ε is an **augment**, a marker on a finite verb that indicates that **the finite verb is in a past tense and in the indicative mood**. Note how that is phrased: the augment is applied *only* to **finite verbs in the indicative mood**, not participles, infintives, or finite verbs in other moods.

There are two kinds of augments.
* The ε- discussed above is a **syllabic** augment, so called because it adds an extra syllable to the verb, and it is used when the verb in question begins with a consonant.
* The other kind of augment is a **temporal augment**, used when the verb in question already begins with a vowel. The temporal augment is a *lengthening* of the initial vowel, and you can often compare the first and third principal parts to see how the initial vowel was lengthened. For example, the verb ἀδικέω, "to wrong", has as its third principal part ἠδίκησα, where the initial η is a lengthened form of α.

## Formation

As mentioned in [the verb overview](overview#verb-aspects), the combination of a verb's stem with a set of endings indicates five different aspects of a finite verb.
