## Principal Parts and Memorization

Many verbs have six principal parts, and while it is generally a good idea to memorize them all when you encounter new verbs, that is a lot to keep in mind. So, our goal in this textbook will be to keep the amount of vocabulary at a manageable level for retention and memorization and to suggest some strategies for memorizing piecemeal, rather than all in one fell swoop.

To that end, for the most, if not all, of this semester, we will be working primarily with four of the six principal parts of verbs: 1, 2, 3, and 6. Please memorize those four principal parts and the definition of a verb as you come across new ones. We will format verb entries in the textbook (but not in the isolated vocabulary lists or reference charts) in such a way as to remind you what you should pay attention to: **bolded** principal parts should be memorized, while you can de-prioritize `coded` principal parts. So:

* **δείκνυμι**, **δείξω**, **ἔδειξα**, `δέδειχα`, `δέδειγμαι`, **ἐδείχθην**, "[to show](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n23658)"
* **κελεύω**, **κελεύσω**, **ἐκέλευσα**, `κεκέλευκα`, `κεκέλευσμαι`, **ἐκελεύσθην**, "[to order](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n56496)"

We will use these two verbs primarily in the coming lessons to demonstrate different verb forms and translations, so commit to memory the bolded forms above.
