## Unit Vocabulary

Please refresh yourself on the principal parts for the verbs contained in the units on [first aorist](first-aorist#principal-parts-and-memorization) and [second aorist](second-aorist#unit-vocabulary), especially each verb's first principal part, as we will use them all in this and the coming units.

## The First Principal Part

We have spent a lot of time until now with the third and sixth principal parts in learning about the aorist tense, the tense of instantaneous or completed actions in the past, in all voices. We will move now to the other principal part that you've been asked to memorize for new verbs, the **first principal part**, which we will use to build the forms of two tenses, the **present**, which we'll learn about in this unit, and the **imperfect**, which we'll learn about in the next unit.

***

## Present Tense

The **present** tense, as discussed [in the verb overview](overview#verb-aspects), indicates an action that is occurring right now. While the translation of the aorist is pretty narrowly defined (as the simple past tense of a verb, often its "-ed" form) to differentiate it from the imperfect, there are a few different ways in which we can translate the present tense. Here are a few examples:

* "They order" (simple present)
* "They are ordering" (progressive present)
* "They do order" (emphatic present)

These are all present tense versions of the same verb, "to order", in the 3rd plural; each version refers to an action that is happening now. The variations simply cover different types of action: the simple present, like the aorist, implies an instantaneous action; the progressive present indicates an action that is in the process of happening, like the imperfect; and the emphatic present, as the name implies, emphasizes an action and is also used in questions (e.g., "do they order?"). Context will often help guide you towards one of these translations more strongly than the others.

Like the aorist, the present tense can be expressed in any of the three voices. For example:

* active: "They order"
* middle: "They order (for themselves)"
* passive: "They are (being) ordered"

Unlike the aorist, however, all three voices are built on one principal part, the first. Also unlike the aorist, we will have one set of forms for the active voice and one set of forms for the middle *and* passive voices, so we will need context to help us determine whether a form is middle or passive.

## Present Indicative (-ω and -μι)

Recall from [the verb overview](overview#conjugation) that the ending of the first principal part indicates to what **conjugation** it belongs: -ω or -μι. The distinction between -ω and -μι verbs is similar to that between first and second aorists: the grouping determines what sets of endings we can use to conjugate the verb, but it doesn't affect the verb's core aspects. A 3rd singular present active indicative -ω verb is the same as a 3rd singular present active indicative -μι verb in terms of when the verb happens, who performs it, etc.; all that differs is the ending that we use to indicate those verbal aspects.

-ω verbs are also considered **thematic verbs**, so called because the personal endings are a combination of a **thematic/theme vowel** (-ο- before μ or ν, -ε- elsewhere) and a true personal ending that indicates person and number. In some endings of this type, it can be difficult to extricate the theme vowel from the true personal ending, but this distinction is important when we compare thematic verbs against **-μι verbs**, which are **athematic**, meaning that there is no -o- or -ε- between the verb stem and the personal ending.

### Present Active

As with the aorist, the conjugation of the present is a matter of combining a verb stem with a set of personal endings. In this case, our stem comes from the **first principal part**, and there is a new set of personal endings that you must memorize.

Here are the steps to conjugate a verb in the present active.
1. Get the verb's **present stem** by taking -ω or -μι off the first principal part.
2. Apply the appropriate **personal endings**, depending on whether the verb is -ω or -μι.
3. Apply a **recessive accent** based on the rules laid out [in the unit on accents](../basics/alphabet-and-accents#accents).

#### Present Active Endings (-ω)

| Person | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st | `-ω` | `-ομεν` |
| 2nd | `-εις` | `-ετε`|
| 3rd | **-ει** | **-ουσι(ν)** |

#### Present Active Endings (-μι)

| Person | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st | `-μι` | `-μεν` |
| 2nd | `-ς` | `-τε`|
| 3rd | **-σι(ν)** | **-ασι(ν)** |

#### Application

Let's use κελεύω and δείκνυμι as our sample verbs for the present active.

1. Our respective stems are κελευ- and δεικνυ-.
2. When we want to conjugate these verbs in the 3rd person singular and plural, we must keep in mind to which conjugation each verb belongs. κελεύω is an -ω verb; thus, we'll attach the endings -ει and -ουσι(ν) for the present active. δείκνυμι is a -μι verb; thus, we'll attach the endings -σι(ν) and -ασι(ν) for the present active.
3. The 3rd singular of κελεύω will be accented on the penult, since the ending -ει draws the accent forward. The other three forms will be accented on the antepenult, due to their short ultimas.

Here are our resulting forms:

| Verb | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| κελεύω | κελεύει | κελεύουσι(ν) |
| δείκνυμι | δείκνυσι(ν) | δεικνύασι(ν) |

#### Translation

The verbal aspects that we took into consideration when learning about the aorist also apply here; simply swap in present tense for aorist tense.
