## Course Description

This course is an introduction to the ancient Greek language, the mode of communication that defines the literature and culture of ancient Greece. No previous knowledge of Greek or Latin is required. This course will start from the very basics of the Greek language (i.e., alphabet, parts of speech, inflection, pronunciation) and eventually build towards a strong command of Greek vocabulary, grammar, and syntax. The goal of first-year Greek (consisting of this course and its counterpart and continuation, GREK 102 - Introduction to Greek 2) is to build a solid foundation for reading actual ancient Greek texts. As such, the acquisition of those linguistic skills, elucidated and practiced through classroom instruction and examples, will also be reinforced by the reading of select prose and poetry passages in Greek.
